Max 4 filppers on screen at once, added with a very low time in between (excluding tanker initiated flippers probably?)
Immediately after killing a flipper, another takes its place.
Losing a life doesn't rest the level - the number of enemies left remains the same.
Enemies shoot! (Usually very early. Sometimes toward the end as well).
Max 8 player bullets on the screen at once!
Level 1:
 - 10 flippers
 - Flippers don't flip
Level 2:
 - 11 flippers?
 - Flippers flip (and quite fast)
Level 3:
 - Tankers - but how do they fit in? Seems like 1 tanker + 2 flippers. But then changes up quickly after :(
